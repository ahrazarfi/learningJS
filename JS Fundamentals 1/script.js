//VALUES AND VARIABLES
/* we can store values into variables using the let keyword
this is called declaring a variable.
suppose a variable is a box which can hold some things. We can write a label on the box to find it later or reuse it. Variable works exactly in the same way where the variable name is the label and the value is the thing according to the above analogy. */

//Conevntions and rules for naming variables
/* 
--->camelCase convention
    example -> firstName, firstNameAndLastName.
    - it is a convention to not start variable name with an UPPERCASE letter as that is used in OOP JS.
    - variable names should be descriptive.
---> Some hard rules for naming variables
    - varible names can only contain letters, numbers, underscore _,  or dollar $ sign. Ex- ab&ad (illegal), $abc (legal).
    - variable names should not be reserve keywords in JS. ex- new, function
    - Variables cannot start with a number. Ex- 3abc (illegal variable  name)
